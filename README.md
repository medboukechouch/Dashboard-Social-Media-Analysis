## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are to:

- Analyze user engagement metrics (likes, comments, shares)
- Track brand mentions and sentiment trends
- Compare performance across different social media platforms
- Identify the most engaging content types and optimal posting times
- Provide decision-support insights through interactive dashboards
